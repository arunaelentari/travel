# Valencia: vast beaches and magnificent parks

A Pic of me with the dragon castle

I have just spent three days in Valencia, the third largest city
in Spain and the capital of the autonomous community of Valencia,
located on the banks of the river Turia.

The city has a rich history, having been founded by Romans in 138 BC
abd occupied by Moroccan and Arab Moors for a little over 500 years
from 714 to 1238 AD. In 1238, it was reconquered by the crown of Aragon. 
It had a brief stint as the capital of Spain on two occasions, 
in 1812 and between 1936 and 1937. The city was originally named as 
Valentia which meant "valor" or "strength".

The two main tourist attractions in Valencia are its magnificent Turia
Gardens and its vast beaches. 

## The Turia Gardens

The Turia Gardens is home to the famed City of Arts and Sciences 
(see my post, "The spaceship has landed in Valencia" to learn more about that).

But it is most more than that! Being one of the largest urban parks in Spain,
it runs through the city for nine kilometers and has long foot and biking paths,
playgrounds, including park Gulliver, the Museum of Natural Sciences, fountains, 
beautiful bridges,large arenas for concerts and gorgeous sculptures among other things.

It is easy to ride into and out of the park on a bike and there are several long
biking paths that lead directly to the park. There is even a metro station in the park.

I rented a bike in the park for 12 euros for the whole day and biked through
the entire park. During my trip, I encountered a couple of people practicing
a Chinese dragon dance, a performance of some sort, lots of families with young
children, many other bikers as well as rollerbladers and many beautiful sites.

## Valencia Beaches

Valencia beaches are vast and extend for many kilometers.

The two main beaches are Las Arenas and La Malvarrosa. Frankly, it is hard for me
to know where one ends and another starts. You can take a long walk, bike or rollerblade
along the beach. There are also many restaurants and cafes nearby. 

I love how much spacious it is there!
