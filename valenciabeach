# The spacious beaches of Valencia

a pic of Leo on the beach

The first thing that struck me about Valencia beach is how vast it is.
Stretches of soft yellow sand kept going for some time before reaching the water. 
The water was still warm and pleasant in the middle of October.

A few entrepreneurial people made beautiful sand castles for display. What a creative 
way to make a living!

Further from the beach, a long row of tall palms, planted in an orderly fashion, 
created a spacious corridor, creating a nice place for a leisurely stroll.

There is a wonderful restaurant not far from the beach
