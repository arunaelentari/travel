Dear friends,

an English mathematician, writer as well as the first programmer.

She is the only legitimate child of Lord Byron, one of the greatest British poets. 

Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on 
Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine where she explained its function and 
how it differed from the original Difference Engine in the appended notes. 

Babbage called her the Enchantress of Number and wrote to her in 1843: 

"Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous 
Charlatansâ€”every thing in short but the Enchantress of Number."

She is a source of inspiration to me and others, the lovely Ada Lovelace.
