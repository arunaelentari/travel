I love swimming in the Mediterranean Sea when it is sunny and the water is warm, 
the sand is soft and the sky is blue. I love seeing the sandy bottom of the Sea, 
watching the light make beautiful patterns in the water, turning it turquoise color,  
and a school of fish swim by as I dive in. To experience all that on a summer day is 
wonderful but to be able to enjoy all this in October is pure joy to someone 
who has spent the last three winters in Sweden. I have just had this
amazing experience during a week-long stay in Alicante.

I spent my mornings and early afternoons, and sometimes the whole day, alternating between swimming and 
sunbathing. The Sun rose at eight in the morning, and by nine it was high enough in the sky to enjoy my swimming ritual. 
The temperature in the water was 24-25 degrees C and the sky was blue, with occasional clouds adorning it. 
The sand was soft, warm and pleasant to walk on day and night. The beach eased gently into the Sea, 
allowing one to walk 20-25 meters before the water reached one's chin, making it a perfect playground 
for children. The sight of the Castle of Santa Barbara, the palms and the colorful buildings along 
the beach added to the beautiful surroundings.

Swimming in the Sea is for me a spiritual experience. I love it when it envelops me gently and supports
me as I fully relax into it and let go while gazing into the sky. I love the smell, the sound, the touch,
and even the taste of the Sea. I feel as if I am back home after a long journey into the land 
where my body had to constantly fight gravity. Swimming in the Sea feels effortless, as if I am massaging
the water and gliding through it. These feelings and sensations remind of the quote from the book by
Neil Shubin, "Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body": 
“knowing something about the deep origins of humanity only adds to the remarkable fact of our existence: all of our extraordinary capabilities arose from basic components that evolved in ancient fish and other creatures.” There is 
something buried deep inside us that awakes when we are swimming, something pre-mammalian that needs to be 
acknowledged. It is time to discover your inner fish.
