# Rediscover your inner fish in the Sea in Alicante

I love swimming in the Mediterranean Sea when it is sunny and the water is warm, 
the sand is soft and the sky is blue. I love seeing the sandy bottom of the Sea, 
watching the light make beautiful patterns in the water, turning it turquoise color,  
and a school of fish swim by as I dive in. To experience all that on a summer day is 
wonderful but to be able to enjoy all this in October is pure joy to someone 
who has spent the last three winters in Sweden. @hkjn and I have just had this
amazing experience during our week-long stay in Alicante.

I spent my mornings and early afternoons, and sometimes the whole day, on the beach that 
was only a few blocks away from where we were staying. The Sun rose at eight in the 
morning, and by nine it was high enough in the sky to enjoy my swimming ritual. The tem-
perature in the water was 24-25 degrees Celsius and the sky was almost always perfectly blue, 
with occasional clouds adorning it. The sand was soft, warm and pleasant to walk on day and
night. The beach eased gently into the Sea, allowing one to walk 20-25 meters before the water 
reached one's chin, making it a perfect playground for young children.

Swimming in the Sea is for me a spiritual experience. I love it when it envelops me gently and supports
me as I fully relax into ti and let go while gazing into the sky. I love the smell, the sound, the touch,
and even the taste of the Sea. I feel as if I am back home after a long journey into the land 
where my body has to constantly fight gravity. Swimming in the Sea feels effortless, as if I am massaging
the water and gliding through it. This is where I belong.
