I am verry happy that [SteemFest](https://steemit.com/steemfest/@arunaelentari/steemfest-in-lisbon-a-crazy-five-day-long-party) took place in Lisbon or we would have missed this beautiful city and another gem very close to it, [Sintra](https://steemit.com/travel/@arunaelentari/if-you-like-castles-and-hiking-go-to-sintra). I was particularly impressed by Lisbon's street art which was elaborate and simply gorgeous.

As I was exploring Lisbon by foot, I thought I should ride one of the cute streetcars that are ubiquitous throughout the city, so I got a ticket for three euros and fifty cents at the streetcar below, and was really looking forward to get a tour of the city.

The streetcar, though, only rode down a hill, which was admittedly really beautiful since it contained some of the best street art I have seen, and stopped after about 2-3 minutes. Everybody on the tram was slightly surprised, especially a Russian boy, who was shocked and repeatedly asked his parents "Is that it?!?" and then, disappointedly: "We just rolled down a hill for three euros". I went up the hill and took a few pics of the street art which I would like to share with you.
