# Walk with me in the Buen Retiro Park of Madrid

A pic 

Today, I took a long walk in the Buen Retiro Park, literally
translated as the Park of the Pleasant Retreat, located near 
the famous Prado museum. My intent was actually to visit the 
museum but there was a long line of people waiting to 
purchase the tickets, so I decided to skip the museum and 
explore the area nearby instead. 

3 pics (the long line, sculpture, Leo)

To the right of the Prado museum, on the way to the park,
stands a beautiful church, San Jeronimo el Real.

The park is quite magnificent, with its sculptures, fountains,
ponds, flowers and trees of alls sorts and shapes. 

4-5 pics

I listened briefly to a band of musicians playing "When the Saints
Go Marching In" next to a fountain.

2 pics (musicians and the fountain)

One particular sculpture that drew my attention is the monument
to the king Alfonso XII, surrounded by a semicircular colonnade 
and overlooking the Retiro Pond.

3-4 pics

I was very happy to see the sculpture dedicated to Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal,
a Nobel Prize winning neuroscientist famous for his beautiful drawings of
neurons.

I think he would have preferred to have more modern clothes and a microscope
rather than wearing a toga in the sculpture:).
