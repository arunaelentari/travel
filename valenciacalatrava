# The spaceship has landed in Valencia

A pic of the Imax and the opera house in the evening

Yesterday I stepped into the future as I entered the City of Arts and Sciences
located in the Turia Gardens in Valencia. I was struck by the sheer beauty of its
architecture with the light turquoise waters surrounding them, creating a strong
feeling that I was in a scifi movie or in a transhuman society.

The creative minds behind the City's architectural design are two extraordinary visionaries,
[Santiago Calatrava](https://calatrava.com/)
and [Félix Candela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Candela). The project
was inaugurated in 1998 with the opening of L'Hemisfèric, an IMAX theater, planetarium and laserium.

Two pics of the IMAX theater (one in the front) and another with me. 

It was fun to wach a movie about dinosaurs at L'Hemisfèric and the ticket cost only 9 euros.

Another stunning building which looked like a spaceship is el Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia, 
an opera house and performing arts center. I was interested in the Madama Butterfly by Puccini 
that performed that night but the tickets were sold out.
