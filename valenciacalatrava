# The spaceship has landed in Valencia

A pic of the Imax and the opera house in the evening

Yesterday I stepped into the future as I entered the City of Arts and Sciences
located in the Turia Gardens in Valencia. I was struck by the sheer beauty of its
architecture with the light turquoise water surrounding its futuristic buildings,
creating a strong feeling that I was either in a scifi movie or in a transhuman society. 

3 pics (me standing in front of the imax, under the bridge, a map of the city)

The creative minds behind the City's architectural design are two extraordinary visionaries,
[Santiago Calatrava](https://calatrava.com/)and
[Félix Candela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Candela). The project
was inaugurated in 1998 with the opening of L'Hemisfèric, an IMAX theater, planetarium and laserium.

Two pics of the IMAX theater (one in the front), one inthe back with me.

The shutter is built to reveal the dome, the "iris" of the eye, which is the Ominax theater.

Another stunning building which looked like a helmet of a giant transformer or a spaceship
is el Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia, an opera house and performing arts center. 

2 pics of the opera house (one with me, one as a helmet on the side)

I was interested in the Madama Butterfly by Puccini for that night but the tickets were sold out.
