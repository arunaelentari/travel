# The spaceship has landed in Valencia

A pic of the Imax and the opera house in the evening

Yesterday I stepped into the future as I entered the City of Arts and Sciences
located in the Turia Gardens in Valencia. I was struck by the sheer beauty of its
architecture with the light turquoise water surrounding its futuristic buildings,
creating a strong feeling that I was either in a scifi movie or in a transhuman society. 

3 pics (a cobra pic of the palace, under the bridge, a map of the city)

The creative minds behind the City's design are two extraordinary visionaries,
[Santiago Calatrava](https://calatrava.com/)and
[Félix Candela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Candela). There
are seven structures in the complex. 

## L'Hemisfèric

The City was inaugurated in 1998 with the opening of L'Hemisfèric,
an IMAX theater, planetarium and laserium.

Two pics of the IMAX theater (one in the front), one in the back with me.

The shutter is built to reveal the dome, the "iris" of the eye, which is the Ominax theater.

Another stunning building which looked like a helmet of a giant transformer
is el Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia, an opera house and performing arts center. 

2 pics of the opera house (one with me, one as a helmet on the side)

I was interested in the Madama Butterfly by Puccini for that night but the tickets were sold out. 

3 pics of the opera house (with Leo, the long pole)

Across the bridge stood L'Umbracle, a structure consisting of many connected arches which
houses plants native to Valencia and many beautiful sculptures.

3 pics (outside, with the blue sculpture and me sitting on one sculpture).

Along L'Umbracle is el Museu de les Ciències Príncipe Felipe, an interactive
museum of science that supposedly resembles a skeleton of a whale. 

2-3 pics from diff angles.

In between these two structures is a pool of water that currently has a few sculptures,
all apparently of female heads with hats.

The back of the museum faces a harp-like bridge, el Pont de L'assut de L'or.

With its height of 125 meters it easily serves as a landmark that you can use to navigate 
when lost in the city.
