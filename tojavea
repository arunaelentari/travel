# A scenic bus ride from Alicante to Jávea

A beautiful pic of ALICANTE

Alicante was a great city to visit, with its beautiful beaches and historical sites
(see my previous posts, Discover your inner fish in the sea in Alicante and Sit on
the Iron Throne in Alicante) but having a spent a week here, it was high time for us to 
explore other parts of Spain.

The next stop was Jávea (Xàbia in Valencian), a town north of Alicante along the Costa
Blanca. The bus ride from Alicante took three hours and cost around 10 euros. It was 
easy to buy the tickets from a machine at the station and the ride itself was very 
pleasant. We stopped at several beach towns, of which Altea struck me as particularly pretty.

We arrived in Jávea in the afternoon and took an hour-long walk from the bus station to 
the apartment which we found via airbnb. The apartment was very close to the beach. 
I immediately notice that the town had a completely different feel to it. 
Whereas Alicante was a bustling city which offered more than the beach, Jávea was 
mostly a beach town and, strangely, felt like a US resort town. It is a great place
for families with young children.

We enjoyed our apartment and cooking our own meals. I am still pleasantly surprised 
after every grocery trip: the food is high quality and very reasonably priced. We got a 
bottle of rosé wine for less than 2 euros. It was one of the best wines we have ever had. 

Today, we are leaving for Valencia and are planning to spend three nights there. I am 
looking forward to exploring the third largest city in Spain after Madrid and Barcelona. 
Will write a post on it in a few days.
