## Emerita Augusta
Emerita Augusta, present day Mérida, was founded in 25 BC by Augustus, the first Roman emperor, as a retirement place for veterans or emeriti soldiers. It was a capital of the Roman province of Lusitania which comprised a large part of present day Portugal, including Lisbon.

It has been a UNESCO world heritage site since 1993. Eventually, Emerita turned into Mérida, although one can still see the old name in some places like a football field. Mérida is the capital of the autonomous community of Extremadura in western central Spain.

We took a train from Madrid to Badajoz and arrived at Mérida at 9 in the evening after a four and half long train ride. The landscape between Madrid and Mérida mostly consisted of olive trees and grape vines. It was surprisingly warm when we arrived. The walk from the train station to the apartment, which we found via airbnb, took 30 min, and on our way there I calculated that the population of Mérida was around 50,000 based on the size of the buildings which were mostly two or three stories high. It is actually around 60,000.

### The Roman Theater

It was in Mérida that I began to fully areciate the extent to which the Roman empire affected the world with its culture, language and architechture. I fell in love with the Roman architecture, especially the Roman Theater which hosts annual summer festivals of Classical Theater. I wish I could attend one of those performances.

The theater was constructed shortly after the founding of the city, between 16 and 15 BC. The sculpture in the middle was of the wife of Emperor Augustus as goddess Ceres, a goddess of fertility and agriculture.

To the left and the right of Ceres are different representations of Augustus as well as other sculptures. I wonder if ancient Romans looked like the Roman ideal in sculptures. If yes, what a nice sight it must have been:).

Behind the theater is a nice garden with more statues including, of course, that of Augustus, who almost reached the status of a god after his death.

Here is my imitation of a pose of the sculpture of an actress, highlighting my beautiful tan:).

### The Amphitheater

Next to the theater stands the Amphitheater where the Romans enjoyed gladiatorial fights and combats between men and exotic beasts. It had a capacity for 15,000 specators.

Just as in the modern stadiums, there were posh seats (although not literally, since they were made of stone) reserved for high status people, like senators.

Much of gear worn in the fights was quite exotic and was not fit for actual fights. There were many different types of outfits and combatants depending on the nature of the fight (man vs. beast).

Although my first reaction to gladiatorial games is that of horror and disdain, upon further thinking I can see the value of this type of entertainment such as bringing people together and giving enslaved people an opportunity for freedom if they are lucky or strong enough to win one of the games. It is still something that is hard to understand for a modern person, but in that context and moral climate it may have seemed reasonable.

Adjacent to the Roman Theater and the Amphitheater is a beautiful garden with roses and cyprus trees.

I came across a cute cat in the garden which looked a little scared. Little did I know that I would meet more of its kind, in unimaginable quantities... but this I will share with you a little later.

One can spend a few lovely hours admiring the theater and the amphitheater or taking a break in the shade while listening to a chorus of birds. Of course, I needed to do some shopping at the store adjacent to the sites which was quite delightful since it had an assortment of many beautiful yet tiny things. As a traveler, I had to get rif od many things to lighten up my backpack and become a minimalist. I came up with a smart compromise (which I was very proud of) by choosing to buy small, light things that would remind me of my favorite places. In this case, I purchased a set of earrings of Bast, an owl pendant which is the symbol for the Roman goddess of wisdom Minerva or Athena in Greek mythology and a few other small things that I just couldn't resist.
