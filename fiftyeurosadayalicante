# Living for under 50 euros a day in Alicante

A pic

It has been two weeks since @hkjn and I left Sweden and started our 
travels in Spain but it feels at least twice as long due to the 
variety and intensity of experiences. Today, I would like to share some 
tips about living for under 50 euros a day in a nice city like Alicante.

1. Rent a room via airbnb or stay at a hostel.

2. Buy groceries from a local store and cook your own meals.

3. Eat at places where locals eat.
