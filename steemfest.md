I had a pleasure of attending SteemFest in Lisbon last week. I still need time to process and internalize all the impressions from this intense five-day long partying with amazing people from all over the world, delicious food and excellent Portuguese wine in the middle of a three thousand year old city that is Lisbon. I think writing about it will help me decompress and actually remember all the great people I have met, the beautiful sights I have seen and the conversations I have had which right now are kind of a blur due to the high intensity of the experiences which were somewhat overwhelming at times for an introvert such as myself. Plus, it will give all of you who haven't attended SteemFest an idea of what it was all about and wish you were there too;).

We arrived in Lisbon on Tuesday afternoon after a short train ride from Sintra where we had stayed for three nights. More on Sintra in the next (overdue) post.

Wednesday morning, @hkjn went to the hackathon while I spent the day exploring Lisbon and visiting the National Museum of Ancient Art. Even before I went to SteemFest I already met a fellow steemian, @basilmarples, a cheerful fellow, in our airbnb apartment. In the evening, we went to meet other steemians at the welcoming drinks night at the Hotel HF Fenix. That night I met @oscarcc89, a young artist who came all the way from Venezuela to SteemFest. He won a competition with [@cervantes](https://steemit.com/@cervantes), a Steemit Spanish-speaking community which sponsored his trip to SteemFest. This was his first trip outside Venezuela and I was glad to see that he was really enjoying it! It was fun talking to him in Spanish which was easy to do after a few glasses of wine.

The next morning, @hkjn and I took a shuttle along with other steemians to the Cultural Center of Belem, a venue for the first day of presentations and is the largest building with cultural facilities in Portugal. It was a somewhat gloomy morning with heavy rain and more rain to be expected later that day.

After a cup of espresso (which became my favorite day drink since my arrival in Portugal!) and chatting, we went to the welcome speech by @roelandp, who was, in my opinion and that of many others I spoke to, the star of the entire show.

He and his small team, led by @firepower, did a fabulous job of organizing and running SteemFest. The choice of venues, entertainment, food and drinks was impeccable. The shuttles took us to the places we need to be, the staff was polite and professional, the wine was flowing, and the food just kept coming. All we needed to do is to relax, socialize, eat, drink, talk and watch. 

I mostly skipped the presentations and spent the time chatting with people and consuming alarmingly huge quantities of coffee. I hung out with @oscarcc89 again and met lovely @nelyp, a curator for @cervantes.

I also met a fellow Swede, @markwhittam, who had to flee Sweden because he wanted to homeschool his kids. I can't wrap my mind around the idea that the Swedish government has about taking away children from their loving parents and putting them in an institution as a punishment for wanting to homeschool them. Considering that homeshooling is permitted in many other countries and often proves to be more effective than going to school, I think it is somewhat totalitarian of Sweden to treat its own citizens in such an unreasonable way.

I also met @yoganarchista who radiated inner beauty and playfulness, and was one of the steemians I would love to stay in touch with if I can. I guess I have to visit Berlin soon!

On the first day, I attended two presentations that I found somewhat interesting. The first one was by @jexblackmore, the national spokesperson for the Satanic Temple, who shared her work with us. Although her presentation appeared somewhat innocuous to me and quite playful, a few in the audience got freaked out by it. I guess the word "satan" has a very strong negative connotation, especially among those with a Christian background. It was amusing to see those reactions. As far as I understand from the talk, the Satanic Temple is an organization of atheists and agnostics who like to make people in power and those with strong convictions uncomfortable by drawing their attention and that of the media to themselves through satirical theatrical performances. They also have politicsl campaigns promoting religious freedom.

The other talk was by @dollarvigilante, a stylish man who seemed to have positively influenced quite a few people and brought them to Steemit. His talk mostly focused on some flaws that Steemit has and vague suggestions, one of which included hiring him to improve their marketing.

I had great conversations with a few other steemians such as @joythewanderer, @cryptofunk, @starkerz, @jerrybanfield, @mynewlife, @juanmiguelsalas and @ana.telepova who, along with her partner @anasya founded flacoin.io, a social media platform for women.

Having had enough of talks and chatting, I decided to take a stroll and explore Belem in the afternoon. By that time, the weather cleared up and the beauty of Lisbon was revealed to me in the sunlight.

Of course, I had to see the Bel√©m Tower built in the 16th century, a UNESCO world heritage site which had an important role in the Age of Discoveries.

Having had my second lunch at a nearby restaurant, I went back
